### 💡 Role Description  

<br/>Team won a few RoboCup world awards.

To achieve an **optimal RoboCup competition robot**, the key factors include strong **mentorship and guidance** of both students and doctors of science, with a focus on **concept development, prototype improvement, and component research**. Success relies on integrating **custom solutions, 3D object design, 3D printing, CNC custom parts manufacturing, electronic prototyping, soldering, robot assembling, and testing** into a streamlined development process.

Equally important are **robot efficiency, cost-performance optimization, and the application of embedded systems** such as **Arduino, Raspberry Pi, computer vision, and sensor fusion**. By combining **technical development, knowledge transfer, and innovation**, robotics projects effectively bridge **academic research with practical implementation**, ensuring **efficient, reliable, and cost-effective robots**.

### ⚠️ Note

None.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

**Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, C++, Python, Embedded Systems, 3D CAD Design, 3D Printing, CNC Manufacturing, Electronic Prototyping, Soldering, Custom Hardware Solutions, Robot Testing, Efficiency & Cost Optimization, STEM Mentorship, Knowledge Transfer.**
